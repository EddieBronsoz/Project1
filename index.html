       They have won the most championships in nba history(17).
       They have had a lot of great players on the team.

    <h2>The Greatest Celtic</h2>
      <p>With Bill Russell, the Celtics advanced to the NBA Finals and defeated the St. Louis Hawks in seven games,
      giving the Celtics the first of their record 17 championships. Russell went on to win 11 championships,
      making him the most decorated player in NBA history.  He is considered the best Celtic of all time.  He wore number 6 and was 6 foot 9 inches tall.
      I also think he is the best Celtic of all time but there are other great Celtics such as Paul Pierce and Larry Bird.</p>
